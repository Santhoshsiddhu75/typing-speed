- Card components display proper shadows and spacing
- Input field focus states and validation styling
- Modal/dialog backdrop and positioning behavior
- Loading skeleton components match design system

### Integration Tests

**Responsive Layout Testing**

- Component reflow and text wrapping on small screens
- Touch target sizing on mobile devices (44px minimum)
- Navigation and interaction patterns on different screen sizes
- Typography scaling and readability across devices

**Theme and Animation Integration**
- Dark/light mode switching affects all components consistently
- Animation sequences complete without jarring transitions
- Hover states work correctly across all interactive elements
- Form validation states display proper visual feedback
- Performance impact of animations stays within acceptable limits

**Cross-Browser Compatibility**
- Visual consistency across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- CSS Grid and Flexbox layout behavior

- Typography hierarchy displays correctly
- Color usage follows brand guidelines
- Icon alignment and sizing consistency

**Layout Validation**
- Configuration screen layout at different breakpoints
- Test interface real-time metrics positioning
- Results screen statistics organization and visual hierarchy
- Mobile layout optimization and touch targets
- Desktop layout utilization and component spacing

### Performance Tests

**Core Web Vitals Validation**
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) under 2.5 seconds
- First Input Delay (FID) under 100 milliseconds
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) under 0.1
- CSS bundle size optimization
- Animation frame rate consistency (60fps target)

**Accessibility Testing**
- WCAG AA contrast compliance for all color combinations
- Keyboard navigation functionality
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus indicator visibility
- Motion preference respect (prefers-reduced-motion)

## Mocking Requirements

**Browser APIs**
- **Window.matchMedia**: Mock for responsive breakpoint testing
- **ResizeObserver**: Mock for component resize behavior testing
- **Animation APIs**: Mock for animation performance testing without actual delays

**CSS-in-JS Testing**
- **Computed styles**: Mock CSS property calculations for unit tests
- **Theme context**: Mock theme provider for consistent component testing
- **Media query matching**: Mock responsive behavior for different screen sizes
