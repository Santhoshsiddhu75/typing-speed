# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-26-professional-ui-styling/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-26
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Design System Architecture
- Custom CSS variables for consistent theming across all components
- ShadCN UI component integration with custom styling overrides
- TailwindCSS utility classes for rapid responsive development
- Typography scale using Google Fonts (primary: Inter, secondary: JetBrains Mono for code/metrics)
- Color palette with 9-shade variations for each brand color plus semantic colors
- Spacing system using consistent rem-based scale (0.25rem increments)
- Border radius system with 4 distinct levels (sm, md, lg, xl)

### Brand Color Palette Requirements
- Primary brand color: Modern gradient-capable color (suggested: teal/cyan or purple)
- Secondary accent color: Complementary high-contrast color
- Success/error/warning semantic colors for real-time feedback
- Neutral grays: 9-shade scale from white to near-black
- All colors must pass WCAG AA contrast requirements
- Dark mode variants for all colors

### Component Styling Specifications
- All ShadCN UI components customized to match brand identity
- Consistent button hierarchy: primary, secondary, outline, ghost variants
- Card components with subtle shadows and proper spacing
- Input field styling with focus states and validation feedback
- Modal/dialog components with backdrop blur effects
- Loading states and skeleton placeholders for all components

### Animation and Interaction Requirements
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms) for all hover states and focus changes
- Micro-interactions for button clicks and form submissions
- Progress animations for typing test timer and WPM counter
- Fade-in effects for result statistics with staggered timing
- Subtle parallax or transform effects (performance permitting)
- All animations must respect prefers-reduced-motion accessibility setting

### Responsive Design Implementation
- Mobile-first approach starting at 320px
- Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1536px)
- Touch-friendly button sizes (44px minimum) on mobile
- Optimized layout switching between mobile vertical and desktop horizontal
- Adaptive typography scaling across breakpoints
- Progressive enhancement of visual effects based on screen size

### Performance Optimization
- CSS purging to remove unused TailwindCSS classes
- Optimized asset loading with proper compression
- Minimal JavaScript for animations (prefer CSS)
- Lazy loading for non-critical styling elements
- Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)

## Approach Options

**Option A: Complete ShadCN UI Integration**
- Pros: Consistent component library, accessibility built-in, TypeScript support, rapid development
- Cons: Larger bundle size, some customization limitations

**Option B: Custom Component Library** 
- Pros: Complete control, minimal bundle size, perfect brand alignment
- Cons: Significantly longer development time, accessibility implementation required, testing complexity

**Option C: Hybrid Approach** (Selected)
- Pros: Best of both worlds - ShadCN UI base with extensive customization, faster than full custom
- Cons: Requires deeper understanding of component internals
- Implementation: Use ShadCN UI components as foundation, heavily customize with CSS variables and Tailwind overrides

**Rationale:** The hybrid approach provides the perfect balance for this project. We get the accessibility and structure benefits of ShadCN UI while achieving complete visual control through customization. This approach allows us to create a distinctive brand identity without sacrificing development speed or user experience quality.

## External Dependencies
