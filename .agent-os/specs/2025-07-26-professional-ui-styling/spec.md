## Overview

Transform the current functional typing test interface into a visually stunning, modern, professional design that outshines competitors like LiveChat's typing test while showcasing our superior features and comprehensive statistics in an organized, best-in-class user interface.

## User Stories

### Professional User Experience

As a competitive typist, I want to see a visually impressive interface that feels modern and professional, so that I feel confident using this platform over competitors and want to share it with others.

When I visit the typing test, I'm immediately impressed by the clean, sophisticated design that feels like a premium product. The interface uses professional typography, thoughtful spacing, and a cohesive color scheme that makes all the features feel organized rather than overwhelming. The design works perfectly on my phone during breaks and looks equally impressive on my desktop setup.

### Comprehensive Stats Display

As a professional user, I want all the detailed typing metrics to be beautifully organized and easy to understand, so that I can quickly analyze my performance without feeling overwhelmed by information.

After completing a test, I see all my statistics (WPM, accuracy, characters typed, time elapsed, error rate, consistency) presented in a well-designed results screen that uses visual hierarchy to highlight the most important metrics while keeping secondary stats accessible and readable.

### Mobile-First Excellence

As a student, I want the typing test to work flawlessly on my mobile device with the same professional appearance, so that I can practice typing anywhere without compromising on user experience.

The interface adapts seamlessly from my 320px mobile screen to tablet and desktop, maintaining the same level of visual polish and functionality across all devices. All buttons are properly sized for touch, text is readable, and the layout never feels cramped or awkward.

## Spec Scope

1. **Complete Visual Design System** - Custom brand color palette, typography hierarchy, spacing system, and component styling using ShadCN UI + TailwindCSS
2. **Configuration Screen Redesign** - Professional layout for test duration and difficulty selection with clear visual hierarchy and modern interactions
3. **Test Interface Enhancement** - Real-time metrics display, elegant text highlighting, sophisticated timer and progress indicators with smooth animations
4. **Results Screen Transformation** - Comprehensive statistics display with visual organization, card-based layout, and performance visualization
5. **Responsive Framework Implementation** - Complete mobile-first responsive design from 320px to desktop with optimized layouts for each breakpoint

## Out of Scope

- Backend functionality changes
- New feature development beyond styling
- Complex animations that impact performance
- Custom font creation (will use Google Fonts)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users immediately say "wow" when they see the interface and consider it superior to LiveChat and other competitors
2. All existing features and statistics are beautifully organized and easy to understand despite being comprehensive
3. Perfect functionality and visual appeal across all devices from 320px mobile to desktop displays
