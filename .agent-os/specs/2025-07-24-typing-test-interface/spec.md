> Spec: Basic Typing Test Interface
> Created: 2025-07-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the foundational typing test interface that displays text passages for users to type and provides the core interactive experience. This component will serve as the primary testing interface where users begin their typing speed tests.

## User Stories

### Primary Typing Experience

As a typing test user, I want to see a clean, readable text passage on screen, so that I can begin typing and practicing my speed and accuracy.

The user loads the typing test page and immediately sees a well-formatted text passage displayed prominently. The interface should be intuitive, with clear visual hierarchy showing the text to be typed. Users should be able to start typing immediately without additional setup or configuration.

### Text Passage Variety

As a user practicing typing, I want access to different text passages, so that I can practice with varied content and avoid memorizing specific texts.

The system should provide multiple sample text passages covering different topics, writing styles, and difficulty levels. This prevents users from gaming the system by memorizing passages and ensures more accurate typing speed measurements.

### Responsive Text Display

As a user on different devices, I want the text to be clearly readable on mobile, tablet, and desktop, so that I can practice typing anywhere.

The text display should adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining optimal readability. Font sizes, line spacing, and text width should adjust appropriately for the user's device.

## Spec Scope

1. **Text Display Component** - Create a clean, readable interface for displaying typing passages with proper typography and spacing
2. **Text Passage System** - Implement a system to store and randomly select from multiple sample text passages
3. **Responsive Layout Foundation** - Build the basic responsive framework that will support the typing interface across devices
4. **Typography and Styling** - Establish consistent visual design using TailwindCSS and ensure optimal readability
5. **Component Architecture** - Set up the React component structure that will integrate with future real-time typing features

## Out of Scope

- Real-time typing input capture (separate roadmap item)
- WPM calculation or metrics display (separate roadmap item) 
- User authentication or data persistence (Phase 2)
- Visual feedback for correct/incorrect typing (separate roadmap item)
- Dark mode implementation (Phase 5)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can load the typing test page and see a formatted text passage ready for typing
2. The interface displays different text passages on page refresh or manual selection
3. The layout works responsively across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
