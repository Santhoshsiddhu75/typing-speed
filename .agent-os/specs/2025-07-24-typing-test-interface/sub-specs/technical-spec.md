# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-24-typing-test-interface/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-24
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Create a responsive React component using TailwindCSS for styling and layout
- Implement a text passage management system with multiple sample texts 
- Ensure cross-device compatibility with mobile-first responsive design
- Use ShadCN UI components where appropriate for consistent design system
- Implement proper typography hierarchy with Google Fonts integration
- Create component architecture that supports future real-time typing integration
- Optimize text readability with appropriate font sizes, line height, and spacing
- Support text passage selection or random rotation functionality

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Single Hardcoded Component
- Pros: Simple implementation, minimal state management, fast initial development
- Cons: Difficult to extend, no text variety, poor maintainability

**Option B:** Component with Text Array and Random Selection (Selected)
- Pros: Easy text management, supports variety, simple random selection, maintainable
- Cons: All texts loaded in memory, limited scalability for large text libraries

**Option C:** Dynamic Text Loading from External API
- Pros: Unlimited text variety, efficient memory usage, content management flexibility
- Cons: Network dependency, increased complexity, requires backend implementation

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance for MVP requirements. It supports the needed text variety while maintaining simplicity. The text library size for a typing test won't be large enough to create memory issues, and the random selection provides good user experience without the complexity of external APIs.

## External Dependencies

- **@/components/ui/** - ShadCN UI component library for consistent design system
- **Justification:** Already established in tech stack, provides professional UI components with TailwindCSS integration

- **React state management (useState)** - For managing current text passage and component state
- **Justification:** Built into React, no additional dependencies needed, sufficient for simple state management
