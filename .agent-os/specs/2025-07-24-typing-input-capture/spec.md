# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Typing Input Capture
> Created: 2025-07-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement real-time typing input capture functionality that allows users to type and see immediate visual feedback during typing tests. This feature will capture keystrokes, validate input against the target text, and provide live highlighting of correct/incorrect words.

## User Stories

### Interactive Typing Experience

As a typing test user, I want to type in a responsive input area that captures my keystrokes in real-time, so that I can practice typing with immediate feedback.

The user will see a dedicated typing input area below the text passage. As they type, the system will capture each keystroke, compare it to the expected text, and provide visual feedback showing which words are correct (green) or incorrect (red). The input area will handle common typing scenarios like backspace, corrections, and word completion.

### Real-Time Visual Feedback

As a typing test user, I want to see immediate visual feedback on my typing accuracy, so that I can correct mistakes and improve my typing technique in real-time.

The system will highlight words in the text passage based on the user's current input. Correctly typed words will be highlighted in green, incorrect words in red, and the current word being typed will have a special cursor indicator.

## Spec Scope

1. **Typing Input Area** - Interactive textarea or input component that captures user keystrokes
2. **Real-Time Input Validation** - System that compares user input to target text character by character  
3. **Visual Feedback System** - Live highlighting of correct/incorrect words with color coding
4. **Cursor Position Tracking** - Visual indicator showing current typing position in the text
5. **Backspace and Correction Handling** - Support for editing and correcting typed text

## Out of Scope

- WPM calculation (will be implemented in a future spec)
- Test completion and results display
- Timer functionality
- User authentication features

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can click in a typing input area and type text that is captured in real-time
2. As users type, words in the text passage are highlighted green (correct) or red (incorrect)
3. The system shows a visual cursor indicating the current typing position in the text
