## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**TypingInputCapture Component**
- Test keyboard event listener attachment and detachment on mount/unmount
- Test character validation logic with correct character input
- Test character validation logic with incorrect character input
- Test typing progress tracking with sequential character input
- Test state updates for current position advancement
- Test handling of special characters and punctuation
- Test handling of uppercase and lowercase character validation
- Test component focus management and input area activation

**Character Validation Utility**
- Test correct character matching with exact case sensitivity
- Test incorrect character detection and error flagging
- Test handling of whitespace characters and spaces
- Test validation of punctuation marks and special characters
- Test Unicode character support and encoding handling

**Typing Progress Manager**
- Test cursor position advancement with correct input
- Test cursor position maintenance with incorrect input
- Test progress calculation through text passage
- Test character counting accuracy
- Test progress state reset functionality

### Integration Tests

**Typing Input Flow**
- Test complete keystroke capture to validation to state update flow
- Test multiple rapid keystrokes without dropped characters or state corruption
- Test typing progress through an entire sample text passage
- Test component integration with text display component for cursor positioning

**Event Handling Integration**
- Test keyboard event propagation and proper event handling
- Test focus management when clicking into and out of typing area
- Test typing session initialization and cleanup
- Test component behavior with different text passage lengths

### Mocking Requirements

- **Keyboard Events:** Mock KeyboardEvent objects for simulating various keystroke combinations and special characters
- **Timer Functions:** Mock setTimeout/setInterval if any debouncing or throttling is implemented for performance optimization
- **Text Passages:** Mock sample text content for consistent testing across different passage types and lengths
