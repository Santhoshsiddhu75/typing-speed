# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-24-typing-input-capture/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-24
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- React component with focused input handling using onKeyDown and onKeyPress event listeners
- Character-by-character validation logic comparing typed input against target text with proper character encoding support
- State management for typing progress including current position, typed characters array, and error tracking
- Performance optimization to handle rapid keystroke input without lag or dropped characters
- Cross-browser compatibility for keyboard event handling including proper key code mapping
- Support for all standard keyboard characters including letters, numbers, punctuation, and special characters
- Input focus management to ensure typing area remains active during the test session

## Approach Options

**Option A: Single Input Field with Overlay**
- Pros: Simple implementation, native input behavior, built-in accessibility
- Cons: Limited styling control, harder to implement custom visual feedback, potential text selection issues

**Option B: Custom Div with Keyboard Event Capture** (Selected)
- Pros: Complete control over rendering and visual feedback, easier to implement real-time highlighting, better integration with typing test UI
- Cons: More complex implementation, need to handle accessibility manually, requires custom focus management

**Option C: Hidden Input with Visual Layer**
- Pros: Combines input capture benefits with visual control, maintains some native behavior
- Cons: Complex synchronization between input and display, potential focus issues, accessibility complications

**Rationale:** Option B provides the most flexibility for implementing the real-time visual feedback and custom styling requirements of the typing test while giving us complete control over the user experience. The additional complexity is justified by the enhanced user interface capabilities it enables.

## External Dependencies

- **No new external dependencies required** - Implementation uses built-in React event handling and state management
- **Justification:** This feature can be implemented using standard React patterns and native browser keyboard events, avoiding additional bundle size and maintaining simplicity
