## 2025-01-24: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build a modern, interactive Typing Speed Test web application using the MERN stack targeting students, professionals, and typing enthusiasts. The platform will provide real-time feedback, progress tracking, and competitive elements while being monetized through skippable post-test advertisements.

### Context

The typing test market lacks modern, engaging platforms that provide comprehensive analytics and social competition features. Most existing solutions are outdated, don't offer real-time feedback, and lack motivational elements that encourage consistent practice and improvement.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Desktop Application**
   - Pros: Better performance, offline capability, no web hosting costs
   - Cons: Limited reach, platform-specific development, harder distribution and updates

2. **Simple Static Web Page**
   - Pros: Lower development complexity, minimal hosting costs
   - Cons: No user accounts, no progress tracking, limited monetization options

3. **Subscription-Based Model**
   - Pros: Predictable revenue, premium feature justification
   - Cons: Higher barrier to entry, smaller user base, market saturation

### Rationale

The MERN stack web application approach provides the best balance of reach, functionality, and development efficiency. The ad-supported model removes barriers to entry while maintaining revenue potential. Real-time feedback and gamification elements address key gaps in existing solutions.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Broad accessibility across all devices and platforms
- Scalable architecture supporting growth from MVP to enterprise
- Modern tech stack enabling rapid development and maintenance
- Free-to-use model maximizing user adoption
- Comprehensive feature set differentiating from competitors

**Negative:**
- Higher initial development complexity compared to simple solutions
- Dependency on ad revenue requires significant user base for profitability
- Web platform performance limitations compared to native applications
- Ongoing hosting and maintenance costs
